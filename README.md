Some rules to help us better manage git:
- Remember the golden rule: git add * -> git commit -m -> git push 
- You should notify group mate after every commit 
- Resolve merge conflict together when you encounter one
- Every time you trying to push something to the remote branch, you should pull all the changes in the remote branch, solve all conflicts in
your local repository, then push(Even at this moment, you should check whether there are updates in the remote branch).
